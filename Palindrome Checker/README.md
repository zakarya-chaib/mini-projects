# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that checks whether a given word or sentence is a palindrome.  
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring case, spaces, and punctuation.

## How It Works

The input is cleaned by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase.  
Then it compares the original input with its reversed version to determine if it’s a palindrome.

## Example

- `eye` → palindrome  
- `Race car` → palindrome  
- `Hello` → not a palindrome
